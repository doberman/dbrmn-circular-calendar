## Documentation

This project contains difference kinds of documentation under the [`/docs`](/docs) folder.

### [`/docs/technical-requirements.md`](/docs/technical-requirements.md)

This document contains the gathered technical requirements that are relevant to this project. This includes requirements such as security, data management, hosting, performance and integrations.

This documentation is useful as input when writing an ADR.

### [`/docs/adr`](/docs/adr)

This folder contains ARD:s, architectural decision records. ADR:s are a useful way
to document decisions made during the length of the project. See the example ADR at
[`/docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`](/docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) for further information on what
an ADR is and how to write one.

### [`/docs/evaluations`](/docs/evaluations)

This folder contains documentation on evaluations made during a decision process. In essence, each evaluation contains a spreadsheet with the different alternatives and the evaluation criteriums. Each criterium is assigned a weight to represent the criteriums importance to the decision. Each alternative gets a score for each of the criteriums. In the end each alternative recieves a total score which is the sum of the factors of the criterium weights and scores.

This documentation is useful as input when writing an ADR.

### [`/docs/drawings`](/docs/drawings)

This folder contains drawings of the project architecture (or anything else really) made with draw.io. See [draw.io](https://draw.io). There is a usefule VSCode plugin for editing draw.io diagrams directly in VSCode, see [Draw.io VS Code Integration](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio)

This documentation is useful as input when writing an ADR.
